# Kickstarter Campaign Data
### Function
The data given is from different Kickstarter campaigns. It shows which ones were successful, and how much money they raised compared to their goal. 
The purpose of this app was to clean up the data, organize it in rows, and highlight the successful and unsuccessful campaigns. This was done through filtering, creating rules and pivot tables. 
### Organization
From left to right, the worksheet is organized. 
Raw Data:  Filtered and formatted so that it is readable. 
Category: Shows the groups by category and shows failed, successful, canceled, and live. 
Sub Category: Breaks the Categories down further so that you can tell which ones have more influence. 
Successful Campaigns: Pivot table that has the campaigns over each month and the different seasons.
Outcome Based on Goal: Groups by goal number and explains a line graph of percent successful through the dollar amount of goal. 
Statistical Analysis: Organized by successful and failed, this gives the statistics of these projects compared to how many backers they had.  
### How to Run
